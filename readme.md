# Version notes

Branch names should reflect the document version, please make a note if otherwise (only in this case) by adding the version to the document name in this readme (e.g. alm-reports 5.7). This is a reminder that this specific document should be updated in this branch.

Always consult the "antora.yml" file in the document to verify, it should contain the correct version number.

# Important on new versions

Always update the "version" entry in the document antora.yml file when creating a new version (and consequently a new branch). This is important for the online help.
